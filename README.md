# Lyrics Corpus

Ultimately, a tokenized corpus of song lyrics. Currently, some tools to scrape
[MetroLyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com) and store the results with
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).

## Usage

Make sure you have a working internet connection and a locally-running MongoDB
server. Then `lein run`.
